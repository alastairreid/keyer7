# Keyer7

Ever since I first saw the
[microwriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwriter), I have been
fascinated by chorded keyboards: single handed keyboards with a handful
(literally) of keys where instead of pressing one key at a time, you press
a "chord" (several keys) to select each letter.

Now that low cost Bluetooth LE devices like the [Adafruit
NRF52](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3406) are cheap and
easy to program, there really was no excuse not to build one.
